DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM

The driver drowsiness.py is a python code which detects drowsiness of the user through a web camera.The Activated_fire_alarm_(sound).ogg  is an ogg file which has an alarm sound in it. Download the file from here or google it and download. 
Make sure you know the path where you have downloaded the file.


Now you also need to download another file 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat'.This is a trained model file which 
is designed for use with dlib's HOG face detector. That is, it expects the bounding boxes from the face detector to be aligned a 
certain way, the way dlib's HOG face detector does it.

I have attached the link for downloading the file https://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2/download or google the file and download it if you want.Make sure you know this path also

Before you try to run driver drowsiness.py  code make sure you have installed all the necessary python libraries i.e dlib, face_utils,OpenCV, numpy, scipy, threading and pygame.
